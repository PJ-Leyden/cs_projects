Data Mining can occur on different types of Data. 
For example:
	 - Database Oriented Data Sets
    	 - Relational Database, Data Warehouse, Transactional Database
	 - Advanced Sets
		 - Data Streams/Sensor Data
		 - Time Series Data, Temporal Data, Sequence Data (Bio Data)
		 - Structure Data, Graphs, Social Networks, Multilinked Data
		 - Object Relational Database
		 - Heterogenous Databases and Legacy Database
		 - Spatial Data, Spatiotemporal Data
		 - Multimedia Databases
		 - Text Databases
		 - Internet (WWW)
		 - Graph Databases

Data Mining Tasks
	 - Classifiication [Predicitive]
		 - Given a collection of records (training set)
    	 - Each record contains a set of attributes as a function. One of which is the class.
		 - The goal is that we can PREDICTE the classes of previously unseen records.
		 - Case 1
		 	 - Fraud Detection = Use credit card transactions to determine if a credit card purchase is real. 

	 - Clustering [Descriptive]
 	 	 - Given a set of data points, each having a set of attributes, and a similar measure among them, find clusters that
 		 	 - Data points in one cluster are more similar to one another.
 		 - Market Segmentation = Subdivide the market into distinct subsets of customers where any subset could conceivably be selected as a 
 		   market target to be reached with a particular marketing strategy.  

 	 - Association Rule Discovery [Descriptive]
 	 	 - Discover dependency rules based on a given set of data.
 	 	 - If .... Then ....  
 	 - Sequential Pattern Discovery [Descriptive]
 	 - Regression [Predictive]
 	 	 - Predict the value of a given continuous valued variable based on the values of other variables assuming a linear model. 
 		 - Deviation Detection [Predictive]

Evaluation of Knowledge
	 - Directly mine only the interesting stuff. 
	 - Requires some domain knowledge as some patterns may be of no interest.  
	 - Measures
	 	 - Descriptive
	 	 - Coverage 
	 	 - Typicality vs. Novelty
	 	 - Accuracy
	 	 - Timeliness
