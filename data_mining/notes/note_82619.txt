Distribute work evenly

Explosion in the amount of data has lead to the need for ways to mine that data efficiently. 
Drowning in data, but starved for knowledge. 

Major sources of info
 - Buisness : Web, E-Commerce, Transactions, Stocks, etc...
 - Science  : Remote sensing, bioinformatics, scientific simulation, etc... 
 - Society  : News, digital cameras, YouTube, Facebook, etc...

Basically we have a SHIT load of data and we gotta do something with it. 

We want to extract interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) patterns
of knowledge from the idiotic amount of data. 

KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)
Knowledge Extraction, Data/Pattern Analysis, Data Archeology, Data Dredging, Information Harvesting, Buisness Intelligence etc...
NOT Data Mining
Simple Search and Query Processing
Expert Systems (Deductive)

ISN'T
 - Look Up Phone Number in Directory
 - Query a Web Search engine for the word amazon
IS
 - Certain Names are more prevlent in certain US locations
 - Group together similar docs returned by the search engine according to context (Rainforest, Amazon.com)

Knowledge found is used in Selection, Data Mining and Pattern Evaluation. 

A Web Mining Framework
 - Data Cleaning
 - Data Integration from Multiple Sources
 - Warehouse the Data
 - Data Cube Construction
 - Data Selection for Mining
 - Mining
 - Presentation of Results
 - Patterns/Knowledge to be stored or used

 Data Mining       => Data Analyst
 Data Presentation => Buisness Analyst
