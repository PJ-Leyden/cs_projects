We now need to arrange a pre-defense meeting sometime the last
week of June.   I would prefer an in person meeting but realize
it is often difficult to arrange a time date for everyone.
We will try to find a time that works for most of us and anyone
who is unable to attend can relay their comments via email.
I am quite flexible (except for Mondays).
