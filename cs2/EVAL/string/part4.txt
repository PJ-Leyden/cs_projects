Functionality:
[?] Correctly parses log file
[n] Prints out entries (all)
[n] Prints out number of bytes
[n] Prints out host
[n] Runs on all provided files

Notes:
* Does not print anything due to loop condition
* Fixed loop condition only runs on log_1_tiny.txt
* Modified headers to change type of data stored (i.e., strings instead of ints.)
* Stores read in line and prints instead of printing logEntry.  So, can not ascertain if parsed correctly.
