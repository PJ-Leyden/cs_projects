Procedural Programming
Program Governed By:
	- Syntax = Construction of Language
	- Semantic = Rules that govern the meaning, loops
	- Stylistic = Readable for human readers 
Primitive Types = string, int, bool, char, double
	- int = long, short, signed, unsigned
	- char = signed, unsigned
	- float = float, double, long double
	- auto = type determined by compiler (C++11)
	- decltype = determine type based on different variable
Operators are built in functions
	- Fixed number of operands
	- Arity = number of operands
		- Unary = 1 operand
		- Binary = 2 operand
		- Ternary = 3 operands
